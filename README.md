## 🍿 About The Project

**MovieDeck** isn't just another movie list. It's an exploration of **User Interface Design**, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with standard web technologies. 

I built this to create a streaming experience that feels **alive**. No clunky menus, no jarring loads—just smooth, translucent layers and neon accents that put the content front and center.

### ✨ What Makes It Special?

*   **Glassmorphism UI**: The interface floats on a blurred, translucent layer, giving it a depth and premium feel rarely seen in web apps.
*   **Instant Search**: Find movies, TV shows, or your favorite actors in milliseconds.
*   **Adaptive Design**: Whether on a 4K monitor or a mobile phone, the layout flows perfectly.
*   **Smart Discovery**: Filter by Genre, Year, or Type and watch the grid update instantly without a page reload.
*   **Personalized**: A functional "My List" and "Watch History" that remembers where you left off.
