# MovieDeck 🎬

![MovieDeck Preview](assets/images/banner.png)

A personal project where I experimented with glassmorphism UI design. I wanted to build a movie streaming interface that rivals the big players like Netflix, Prime Video, and Apple TV—but feels even smoother.

## What is this?

I built MovieDeck because most movie apps feel clunky. I wanted something that gives you everything in one place—trailers, reviews, cast details, and recommendations—without jumping through hoops.

It's a Single Page Application (SPA) that pulls data from the TMDB API. No backend, just pure frontend magic.

### Key Features
- **Glassmorphism Design:** A modern, translucent UI that feels premium.
- **Unified Experience:** Watch trailers, read reviews, and check cast details all in one modal.
- **Smart Discovery:** "More Like This" recommendations just like the major streaming platforms.
- **Instant Search:** Find movies, TV shows, or actors instantly.
- **My List:** Save your favorites to watch later (uses local storage).
- **Responsive:** Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## How to Run it

If you want to poke around the code:

1. Clone it:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/itzzharshil/MovieDeck.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

That's literally it. No `npm install`, no complex build steps. I kept it simple on purpose.
